This repo contanins R code for generating a shiny app about _University of Washington_ 
and _Virginia Tech_ Grades and compares the two, using data from an [FOIA request](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jPKV7YmXYSUWG9GeP41rAr64X3UjtzSRHiiUGAjCMAc/edit#gid=0)  

The shiny app has visualizations to answer the following questions:
- How do the GPAs for intro level courses from the University of Washington compare to those of Virginia Tech?
- What are the easiest classes from each school? What are the hardest classes from each school?
- How does the GPA for courses taught by Professors instructing multiple courses compare to those instructing a single class?
- How do class sizes for each department in each school compare between the University of Washington and Virginia Tech?
